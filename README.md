# Code to calibrate an agent-based model of housing abandonment

## Overview

This code is for Srikrishnan & Keller, "Small increases to agent-based model complexity can result in large increases in required calibration data," preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08524.

The model is coded in Python, and the calibration is coded in R.
